DynamoDB Local
==============

Packages Amazon's [DynamoDB Local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html) on OpenJDK. It defaults to using a Shared DB as this is what we use for development.

This is based on Dean Giberson's [package](https://hub.docker.com/r/deangiberson/aws-dynamodb-local/).
